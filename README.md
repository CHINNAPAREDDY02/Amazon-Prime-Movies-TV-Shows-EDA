Project Overview

This project explores the movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The analysis aims to understand how content is distributed on the platform, identify popular genres, examine rating behavior, and observe release trends over time. By converting raw data into insights, the project seeks to support better content-related decision-making.

Dataset
